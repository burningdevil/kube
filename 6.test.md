## Key info

1. Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
2. kube service types: 4
3. A service in kube is a REST object, similar to a Pod.
4. Kubernetes supports 2 primary modes of finding a Service - environment variables and DNS.

## StatefulSets and Deployments

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.  

## DaemonSets and Deployments

DaemonSets are similar to Deployments in that **they both create Pods, and those Pods have processes which are not expected to terminate** (e.g. web servers, storage servers).

Use a Deployment for stateless services, like frontends, where scaling up and down the number of replicas and rolling out updates are more important than controlling exactly which host the Pod runs on. Use a DaemonSet when it is important that a copy of a Pod always run on all or certain hosts, if the DaemonSet provides node-level functionality that allows other Pods to run correctly on that particular node.

## Headless service

StatefulSets currently require a Headless Service to be responsible for the network identity of the Pods. You are responsible for creating this Service.

## Probe

**A probe is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a container.**

## Anti-patterns ?

As we briefly walk through this evolution, we’ll be exploring the concept of anti-patterns, which are common responses to a recurring problem that are usually ineffective and risk being counterproductive.

Even though cloud hosting encouraged modular application design and deployment, many organizations found it enticing to lift and shift legacy applications that had not been designed to work on an elastic distributed architecture directly to the cloud, resulting in a somewhat modern anti-pattern called "monolith hell".

To address these challenges, the industry came up with new architecture patterns like microservices and 12-factor apps.

## Rolling updates

Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones.

## Rollover (aka multiple updates in-flight)

## Reduce docker image size

- Using distroless/minimal base images
- Multistage builds
- Minimizing the number of layers
- Understanding caching
- Using Dockerignore
- Keeping application data elsewhere
