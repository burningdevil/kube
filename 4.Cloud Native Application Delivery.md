# Cloud Native Application Delivery

Devops

CI/CD

## Fundamentals

- version control system like Git.

- With your source code in check, the next step before delivering your application is to build it, which could also include the building of a container image.

- automatic testing of application.

- delivering the application to the platform it should run on.

Today, source code is not the only thing managed in a version control system. To make full use of cloud resources, the principle of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) became popular. Instead of installing infrastructure manually, you describe it in files and use the cloud vendors' API to set up your infrastructure. This allows developers to be more involved in the setup of the infrastructure.

## CI/CD

With services getting smaller and deployments getting more frequent, a logical and important step was the automation of the deployment process. The DevOps movement has highlighted the importance of frequent and rapid deployments.

Automation is the key to overcoming these barriers, and today we know and use the principles of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), which describe the different steps in the deployment of an application, configuration or even infrastructure.

### CI(Continuous Integration)

is the first part of the process and describes the permanent building and testing of the written code. High automation and usage of version control allows multiple developers and teams to work on the same code base.

### CD(Continuous Delivery)

is the second part of the process and automates the deployment of the pre-built software. In cloud environments, you will often see that software is deployed to Development or Staging environments, before it gets released and delivered to a production system.

To automate the whole workflow, you can use a CI/CD pipeline, which is actually nothing more than the scripted form of all the steps involved, running on a server or even in a container. Pipelines should be integrated with a version control system that manages changes to the code base.

Besides the generic scripting of the pipeline steps, modern CI/CD tools have a lot more functionality like direct interaction and feedback from a system like Kubernetes.

Popular CI/CD tools include:

```bash
Spinnaker
GitLab
Jenkins
Jenkins X
Tekton CD
Argo
```

## GitOPs

Infrastructure as Code was a real revolution in increasing the quality and speed of providing infrastructure, and it works so well that today, **configuration, network, policies, or security can be described as code**, and often even live in the same repository as the software.

GitOps takes the idea of Git as the single source of truth a step further and integrates the provisioning and change process of infrastructure with version control operations.

There are two different approaches how a CI/CD pipeline can implement the changes you want to make:

- Push-based  
The pipeline is started and runs tools that make the changes in the platform. Changes can be triggered by a commit or merge request.  
- Pull-based  
An agent watches the git repository for changes and compares the definition in the repository with the actual running state. If changes are detected, the agent applies the changes to the infrastructure.  
Flux built with GitOps toolkit.  
ArgoCD implemented as Kube Controller.
