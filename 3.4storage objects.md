## Volume & Storage Objects

Kubernetes introduces a few solutions, but note that these solutions do not automatically remove all of the complexities of managing storage with containers.

Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath:
      # directory location on host
      path: /data
      # this field is optional
      type: Directory
```

**hostPath Volume Mount**

Volumes allow sharing data between multiple containers within the same Pod. This concept allows for great flexibility when you want to use a sidecar pattern. The second purpose they serve is preventing data loss when a Pod crashes and is restarted on the same node. Pods are started in a clean state, but all data is lost unless written to a volume.

Depending on the environment, we can use cloud block storage like Amazon EBS, Google Persistent Disks, Azure Disk Storage or consume from storage systems like Ceph, GlusterFS or more traditional systems like NFS.

These are only a few examples of storage that can be used in Kubernetes. To make the user experience more uniform, Kubernetes is using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) which allows the storage vendor to write a plugin (storage driver) that can be used in Kubernetes.

Objects can be used

### PersitentVolume(PV)

An abstract description for a slice of storage. The object configuration holds information like type of volume, volume size, access mode and unique identifiers and information how to mount it.

### PersistentVolumeClaims(PVC)

A request for storage by a user. If the cluster has multiple persistent volumes, the user can create a PVC which will reserve a persistent volume according to the user's needs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: test-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 50Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  csi:
    driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: vol-05786ec9ec9526b67
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: centos
      command: ["/bin/sh"]
      args:
        ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /data/out.txt; sleep 5; done"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: persistent-storage
          mountPath: /data
  volumes:
    - name: persistent-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: ebs-claim
```

After the PersistentVolume is provisioned, a developer can reserve it with a PersistentVolumeClaim.

The last step is using the PVC as a volume in a Pod,

It is possible to operate storage clusters directly in Kubernetes. Projects like **Rook** provide cloud-native storage orchestration and integrate with battle tested storage solutions like **Ceph**.
