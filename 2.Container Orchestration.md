# Container Orchestration

## Use of Containers

### Traditional

Servers configured for a purpose and connected by network.

### Virtual Machine or Server Virtualization

Need OS, including kernal. Has overhead to run lots of servers.

### Container

Container can be used to solve these problems, managing dependencies of application and running efficiently than VM.

## Container Basics

**chroot** command of unix. To isolate a process from root filesystem and simulate a new root dir.

![Chroot](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/zlgs2h3aa6bl-chrootdirectoriescanbecreatedonvariousplacesinthefilesystem.png)
**chroot**

To isolate a process even more than chroot can do, current Linux kernels provide features like **namespaces and cgroups**.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are used to isolate various resources, for example the network. A network namespace can be used to provide a complete abstraction of network interfaces and routing tables. This allows a process to have its own IP address. The Linux Kernel 5.6 currently provides 8 namespaces:

- pid - process ID provides a process with its own set of process IDs.
- net - network allows the processes to have their own network stack, including the IP address.
- mnt - mount abstracts the filesystem view and manages mount points.
- ipc - inter-process communication provides separation of named shared memory segments.
- user - provides process with their own set of user IDs and group IDs.
- uts - Unix time sharing allows processes to have their own hostname and domain name.
- cgroup - a newer namespace that allows a process to have its own set of cgroup root directories.
- time - the newest namespace can be used to virtualize the clock of the system.

### cgroups

used to organize processes in hierarchical groups and assign them resources like memory and CPU.

### Containers

While virtual machines emulate a complete machine, including the operating system and a kernel, containers share the kernel of the host machine and, as explained, are only isolated processes.

Virtual machines come with some overhead, be it boot time, size or resource usage to run the operating system. Containers on the other hand are literally processes, like the browser you can start on your machine, therefore they start a lot faster and have a smaller footprint.

### Tools of containers

docker, buildah, kaniko, podman

#### runc

The Open Container Initiative also maintains a container runtime reference implementation.

## Build image

The standard format of a shipping container makes it easy to stack on a container ship, easy to unload with a crane and onto a truck no matter what’s inside.

Container images are what makes containers portable and easy to reuse on a variety of systems. Docker describes a container image as following:

```
“A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.”
```

OCI image-spec. Images consist of a filesystem bundle and metadata.

## Security

When containers are started on a machine, they always share the same kernel, which then becomes a risk for the whole system.

One of the greatest security risks, not only in the container area, is the execution of processes with too many privileges, especially starting processes as root or administrator.

A fairly new attack surface that was introduced with containers is the use of public images.

Docker Hub and Quay is docker image repo.

## Container Orchestration Fundamentals

Having a lot of small containers that are loosely coupled, isolated and independent is the basis for so-called microservice architectures.

Problems can be solved by a system helps with management of containers.

- Providing compute resources like virtual machines where containers can run on
- Schedule containers to servers in an efficient way
- Allocate resources like CPU and memory to containers
- Manage the availability of containers and replace them if they fail
- Scale containers if load increases
- Provide networking to connect containers together
- Provision storage if containers need to persist data.

Container orchestration systems provide a way to build a cluster of multiple servers and host the containers on top.

Kubernetes as the standard system to orchestrate containers.

### Networking

a microservice implements an interface that can be called to make a request.

Network namespaces allow each container to have its own unique IP address, therefore multiple applications can open the same network port.

To make the application accessible from outside the host system, containers have the ability to map a port from the container to a port from the host system.

To allow communication between containers across hosts, we can use an overlay network which puts them in a virtual network that is spanned across the host systems.

![Networking](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/assg25dwbiz3-Routingbetweenhostsandcontainers.png)

Most modern implementations of container networking are based on the Container Network Interface (CNI).

### Service Discovery & DNS

#### Service Registry

all the information like ip address dns is put in a Service Registry.

#### Service Discovery

Finding other services in the network and requesting information about them.

#### Approaches to Service Discovery

##### DNS

Modern DNS servers that have a service API can be used to register new services as they are created.

##### Key-Value-Store

Using a strongly consistent datastore especially to store information about services. A lot of systems are able to operate highly available with strong failover mechanisms. Popular choices, especially for clustering, are **etcd, Consul or Apache Zookeeper**.

### Service Mesh

A lot of functionality like **monitoring, access control or encryption** of the networking traffic is desired when containers communicate with each other.

#### Proxy

The software you can use to manage network traffic is called a **proxy**. It's another container in its nature.

Software: **nginx, haproxy, envoy**

**Istio Architecture**

Serive meshes: **istio, linkerd**

The proxies in a service mesh form the data plane. This is where networking rules are implemented and shape the traffic flow.

These rules are managed centrally in the control plane of the service mesh.

Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project aims at defining a specification on how a service mesh from various providers can be implemented.

### Storage

Container images are read-only and consist layers that include everything you added during build phase. To allow writing files, a read-write layer is put on top of container image when starting a container from an image.

![Container layers](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/mup11dl71nvf-ContainerLayers.png)
**Container Layers**

Read-write layer is lost when container stopped or deleted. To persist data, need to write it to disk.

#### Volume

If a container needs to persist data on host, a volume is needed. This may weaken the isolation of the container.

![Data](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/du5zcuxz6i1b-Dataissharedbetweentwocontainersonthesamehost.png)
**Data shared in 2 containers**

Container orchestration systems like Kubernetes can help to mitigate these problems, but always require a robust storage system that is attached to the host servers.

![Accorss](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/0nq859rs7ktv-Storage.png)
**Storage is provisioned via a central storage system. Containers on Server A and Server B can share a volume to read and write data**

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) came up to offer a uniform interface which allows attaching different storage systems no matter if it’s cloud or on-premises storage.
