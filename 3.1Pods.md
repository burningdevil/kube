# Pods

## Pod concept

A pod describes a unit of one or more containers that share an isolation layer of namespaces and cgroups. It is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which also means that Kubernetes is not interacting with containers directly.

Pod in kube cluster are used in 2 main ways:  

- Pods that run a single container. Most common use case. Pod used as a wrapper around a single container. Kube managers pods rather than the container.
- Pods that run multiple container that need to work together. The co-located containers form a single cohesive unit of a service. Use when only tightly coupled.

### How pods manage multiple containers

All containers inside a pod share an ip address and can share via filesystem. (Networking and storage)  
Pods are designed to support multiple cooperating processes (as containers) that form a cohesive unit of service. The containers in a Pod are automatically co-located and co-scheduled on the same physical or virtual machine in the cluster. The containers can share resources and dependencies, communicate with one another, and coordinate when and how they are terminated.

**Multiple containers share namespace to form a pod**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-sidecar
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.34
    args: [/bin/sh, -c,
            'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done']
```

### sidecar container

Using a second container that supports your main application is called a sidecar container.

### start container

All containers defined are started at the same time with no ordering, but you also have the ability to use **initContainers** to start containers before your main application starts. In this example, the init container init-myservice tries to reach another service. Once it completes, the main container is started.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
```

### Important settings

#### resources

Set a resource request and a maximum limit for CPU and Memory.

#### livenessProbe

Configure a health check that periodically checks if your application is still alive. Containers can be restarted if the check fails.

#### securityContext

Set user & group settings, as well as kernel capabilities.

### Pod update and replacement

As mentioned in the previous section, when the Pod template for a workload resource is changed, the controller creates new Pods based on the updated template instead of updating or patching the existing Pods.

Kubernetes doesn't prevent you from managing Pods directly. It is possible to update some fields of a running Pod, in place. However, Pod update operations like patch, and replace have some limitations:

- Most of the metadata about a Pod is immutable. For example, you cannot change the namespace, name, uid, or creationTimestamp fields; the generation field is unique. It only accepts updates that increment the field's current value.
- If the metadata.deletionTimestamp is set, no new entry can be added to the metadata.finalizers list.
- Pod updates may not change fields other than spec.containers[*].image, spec.initContainers[*].image, spec.activeDeadlineSeconds or spec.tolerations. For spec.tolerations, you can only add new entries.
- When updating the spec.activeDeadlineSeconds field, two types of updates are allowed:
  - setting the unassigned field to a positive number;
  - updating the field from a positive number to a smaller, non-negative number.

### Resouce sharing and communication

#### Storage in Pods

A Pod can specify a set of shared storage volumes. All containers in the Pod can access the shared volumes, allowing those containers to share data. Volumes also allow persistent data in a Pod to survive in case one of the containers within needs to be restarted. See Storage for more information on how Kubernetes implements shared storage and makes it available to Pods.

#### Pod networking

Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address for each address family. Every container in a Pod shares the network namespace, including the IP address and network ports. Inside a Pod (and only then), the containers that belong to the Pod can communicate with one another using localhost. When containers in a Pod communicate with entities outside the Pod, they must coordinate how they use the shared network resources (such as ports). Within a Pod, containers share an IP address and port space, and can find each other via localhost. The containers in a Pod can also communicate with each other using standard inter-process communications like SystemV semaphores or POSIX shared memory. Containers in different Pods have distinct IP addresses and can not communicate by IPC without special configuration. Containers that want to interact with a container running in a different Pod can use IP networking to communicate.

Containers within the Pod see the system hostname as being the same as the configured name for the Pod. There's more about this in the networking section.

### Static Pods

Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. Whereas most Pods are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment), for static Pods, the kubelet directly supervises each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).

Static Pods are always bound to one Kubelet on a specific node. The main use for static Pods is to run a self-hosted control plane: in other words, using the kubelet to supervise the individual control plane components.

The kubelet automatically tries to create a mirror Pod on the Kubernetes API server for each static Pod. This means that the Pods running on a node are visible on the API server, but cannot be controlled from there.

### Container probes

A probe is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a container. To perform a diagnostic, the kubelet can invoke different actions:

ExecAction (performed with the help of the container runtime)
TCPSocketAction (checked directly by the kubelet)
HTTPGetAction (checked directly by the kubelet)

## Pod lifecycle

Pods follow a defined lifecycle, starting in the Pending phase, moving through Running if at least one of its primary containers starts OK, and then through either the Succeeded or Failed phases depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure.

Whilst a Pod is running, the kubelet is able to restart containers to handle some kind of faults. Within a Pod, Kubernetes tracks different container states and determines what action to take to make the Pod healthy again.

In the Kubernetes API, Pods have both a specification and an actual status. The status for a Pod object consists of a set of Pod conditions. You can also inject custom readiness information into the condition data for a Pod, if that is useful to your application.

Pods are only scheduled once in their lifetime. Once a Pod is scheduled (assigned) to a Node, the Pod runs on that Node until it stops or is terminated.

### Pod lifetime

Like individual application containers, Pods are considered to be relatively ephemeral (rather than durable) entities. Pods are created, assigned a unique ID (UID), and scheduled to nodes where they remain until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. If a Node dies, the Pods scheduled to that node are scheduled for deletion after a timeout period.

Pods do not, by themselves, self-heal. If a Pod is scheduled to a node that then fails, the Pod is deleted; likewise, a Pod won't survive an eviction due to a lack of resources or Node maintenance. Kubernetes uses a higher-level abstraction, called a controller, that handles the work of managing the relatively disposable Pod instances.

A given Pod (as defined by a UID) is never "rescheduled" to a different node; instead, that Pod can be replaced by a new, near-identical Pod, with even the same name if desired, but with a different UID.

### Pod phase

A Pod's status field is a PodStatus object, which has a phase field.

The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The phase is not intended to be a comprehensive rollup of observations of container or Pod state, nor is it intended to be a comprehensive state machine.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | ---: |
| Pending | The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes time a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network.|
| Running | The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.|
| Succeed | All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.|
| Failed | All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. |
| Unknown | For some reason the state of the Pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the Pod should be running.|

### Pod States

Once the scheduler assigns a Pod to a Node, the kubelet starts creating containers for that Pod using a container runtime. There are three possible container states: Waiting, Running, and Terminated.

To check the state of a Pod's containers, you can use kubectl describe pod <name-of-pod>. The output shows the state for each container within that Pod.

Each state has a specific meaning:

#### Waiting

If a container is not in either the Running or Terminated state, it is Waiting. A container in the Waiting state is still running the operations it requires in order to complete start up: for example, pulling the container image from a container image registry, or applying Secret data. When you use kubectl to query a Pod with a container that is Waiting, you also see a Reason field to summarize why the container is in that state.

#### Running

The Running status indicates that a container is executing without issues. If there was a postStart hook configured, it has already executed and finished. When you use kubectl to query a Pod with a container that is Running, you also see information about when the container entered the Running state.

#### Terminated

A container in the Terminated state began execution and then either ran to completion or failed for some reason. When you use kubectl to query a Pod with a container that is Terminated, you see a reason, an exit code, and the start and finish time for that container's period of execution.

If a container has a preStop hook configured, that runs before the container enters the Terminated state.

### Container restart policy

The spec of a Pod has a restartPolicy field with possible values Always, OnFailure, and Never. The default value is Always.

The restartPolicy applies to all containers in the Pod. restartPolicy only refers to restarts of the containers by the kubelet on the same node. After containers in a Pod exit, the kubelet restarts them with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s, …), that is capped at five minutes. Once a container has executed for 10 minutes without any problems, the kubelet resets the restart backoff timer for that container.

### Pod conditions

A Pod has a PodStatus, which has an array of PodConditions through which the Pod has or has not passed:

- PodScheduled: the Pod has been scheduled to a node.
- ContainersReady: all containers in the Pod are ready.
- Initialized: all init containers have completed successfully.
- Ready: the Pod is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching Services.

|Field name|Description|
|:---|---:|
|type|Name of this Pod condition.|
|status|Indicates whether that condition is applicable, with possible values "True", "False", or "Unknown".|
|lastProbeTime|Timestamp of when the Pod condition was last probed.|
|lastTransitionTime|Timestamp for when the Pod last transitioned from one status to another.|
|reason|Machine-readable, UpperCamelCase text indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.|
|message|Human-readable message indicating details about the last status transition.

### Container probes

**A probe is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a container.** To perform a diagnostic, the kubelet either executes code within the container, or makes a network request.

Types:

- livenessProbe
- readinessProbe (ready)
- startupProbe


### Terminal of Pods

## Init containers

specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod. Init containers can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image.

A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers, which are run before the app containers are started.

- Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:
- Init containers always run to completion.
Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.


## Ephemeral Containers

This page provides an overview of ephemeral containers: a special type of container that runs temporarily in an existing Pod to accomplish user-initiated actions such as troubleshooting. You use ephemeral containers to inspect services rather than to build applications.
