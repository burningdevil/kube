# Limit

## on container

If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and allowed) for a container to use more resource than its request for that resource specifies. However, a container is not allowed to use more than its resource limit.

```yaml
resources:
	limits:
		memory: "1Gi"
		cpu: "2"
	requests:
		memory: "2500Mi"
		cpu: "1"
```

## on namespace

change ns

`
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=limit
`

The maximum and minimum CPU constraints imposed on a namespace by a LimitRange are enforced only when a Pod is created or updated. If you change the LimitRange, it does not affect Pods that were created previously
