# Encryption Policy File

You can encrypt many objects in the etcd cluster; this configuration narrows it down to only to secrets resources.  
You can have several providers listed, including the same provider more than once. The first key listed is used whenever a resource is persisted to etcd. All the following keys would be kept in case you want to read a previously encrypted resource. If you delete the old keys prior to rewriting the resource, you will not be able to access those resources again.
