# Admission controller

## What is it

In a nutshell, Kubernetes admission controllers are plugins that govern and enforce how the cluster is used. They can be thought of as a gatekeeper that intercept (authenticated) API requests and may change the request object or deny the request altogether. The admission control process has two phases: the mutating phase is executed first, followed by the validating phase. Consequently, admission controllers can act as mutating or validating controllers or as a combination of both. For example, the LimitRanger admission controller can augment pods with default resource requests and limits (mutating phase), as well as verify that pods with explicitly set resource requirements do not exceed the per-namespace limits specified in the LimitRange object (validating phase).

## How to add image pull policy hook

1. kubeconfig

A configuration file describes cluster, users and contexts.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/policywebhook/external-cert.pem
    # URL of remote service to query. Must use 'https'.
    server: https://localhost:1234
  name: image-checker
```

2. AdmissionConfiguration

```json
{
   "apiVersion": "apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1",
   "kind": "AdmissionConfiguration",
   "plugins": [
      {
         "name": "ImagePolicyWebhook",
         "configuration": {
            "imagePolicy": {
               "kubeConfigFile": "/etc/kubernetes/policywebhook/kubeconf",
               "allowTTL": 100,
               "denyTTL": 50,
               "retryBackoff": 500,
               # important! default action to disable
               "defaultAllow": false
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

3. kube api server config

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,ImagePolicyWebhook
    - --admission-control-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/policywebhook/admission_config.json
  volumes:
    ---
  volumeMounts:
    ---
```
