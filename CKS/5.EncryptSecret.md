# Encryption Policy File

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
name: configureKeys
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: encKey
          secret: Ezqai0SIGChGOwf0VdbkFtYPUM2EYf1TAAQbDrfizJQ=
    - identity: {}
```

Then edit api-server yaml file.

```yaml

    volumeMounts:

      path: /etc/kubernetes/enc           # <-- add this line
      type: DirectoryOrCreate             # <-- add this line

```

You can encrypt many objects in the etcd cluster; this configuration narrows it down to only to secrets resources.  
You can have several providers listed, including the same provider more than once. The first key listed is used whenever a resource is persisted to etcd. All the following keys would be kept in case you want to read a previously encrypted resource. If you delete the old keys prior to rewriting the resource, you will not be able to access those resources again.

## Verify that the secret is encrypted

Not important.
