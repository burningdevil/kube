# Kube introduction

## Introduction

Kubernetes is a highly popular open-source container orchestration platform that can be used to automate deployment, scaling and the management of containerized workloads.

By Google and donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF).

Tools around: **container runtimes, monitoring, application delivery tools**.

## Kube Architecture

Kubernetes is often used as a cluster, meaning that it is spanned across multiple servers that work on different tasks and to distribute the load of a system.

Kubernetes clusters consist of two different server node types that make up a cluster:

### Control plane node(s)

Control plane nodes contain various components which manage the cluster and control various tasks like deployment, scheduling and self-healing of containerized workloads.

#### kube-apiserver

This is the centerpiece of Kubernetes. All other components interact with the api-server and this is where users would access the cluster.

#### etcd

A database which holds the state of the cluster. etcd is a standalone project and not an official part of Kubernetes.

#### kube-scheduler

When a new workload should be scheduled, the kube-scheduler chooses a worker node that could fit, based on different properties like CPU and memory.

#### kube-controller-manager

Contains different non-terminating control loops that manage the state of the cluster. For example, one of these control loops can make sure that a desired number of your application is available all the time.

#### cloud-controller-manager

Can be used to interact with the API of cloud providers, to create external resources like load balancers, storage or security groups.

### Worker nodes

The worker nodes are where applications run in your cluster. This is the only job of worker nodes and they donâ€™t have any further logic implemented. Their behavior, like if they should start a container, is completely controlled by the control plane node.

#### container runtime

The container runtime is responsible for running the containers on the worker node. For a long time, Docker was the most popular choice, but is now replaced in favor of other runtimes like containerd.

#### kubelet

A small agent that runs on every worker node in the cluster. The kubelet talks to the api-server and the container runtime to handle the final stage of starting containers.

#### kube-proxy

A network proxy that handles inside and outside communication of your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

Kubernetes also has a concept of namespaces. A Kubernetes namespace can be used to divide a cluster into multiple virtual clusters, which can be used for multi-tenancy when multiple teams share a cluster.

## kubernetes api

The Kubernetes API is the most important component of a Kubernetes cluster. Without it, communication with the cluster is not possible, every user and every component of the cluster itself needs the api-server.

**Access Control Overview**

A request processed by Kube, needs 3 stages:

### Authentication

The requester needs to present a means of identity to authenticate against the API. Commonly done with a digital signed certificate (X.509) or with an external identity management system. Kubernetes users are always externally managed. Service Accounts can be used to authenticate technical users.

### Authorization

It is decided what the requester is allowed to do. In Kubernetes this can be done with Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

### Admission Control

In the last step, admission controllers can be used to modify or validate the request. For example, if a user tries to use a container image from an untrustworthy registry, an admission controller could block this request. Tools like the Open Policy Agent can be used to manage admission control externally.

### Others

Implemented as a RESTful interface exposed over HTTPS. User can create, modify, delete or retrieve resources.

## Running Containers on Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, instead of starting containers directly, you define Pods as the smallest compute unit and Kubernetes translates that into a running container.

Cotainer Runtimes including

### containerd

containerd is a lightweight and performant implementation to run containers. Arguably the most popular container runtime right now. It is used by all major cloud providers for the Kubernetes As A Service products.

### CRI-0

CRI-O was created by Red Hat and with a similar code base closely related to podman and buildah.

### Docker(-shim)

The standard for a long time, but never really made for container orchestration. The usage of Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes has been deprecated and will be removed in Kubernetes 1.23. Kubernetes has a great blog article that answers all the questions on the matter.

Dockershrim is removed and in a result, docker no longer work as a runtime container.

**Using containerd**

provide a runtime that only contains the absolutely essentials to run containers. Nevertheless, they have additional features, like the ability to integrate with container runtime sandboxing tools. These tools try to solve the security problem that comes with sharing the kernel between multiple containers.

Tools: gvisor(Google), Kata Containers

## Networking

Kubernetes distinguishes between four different networking problems that need to be solved:

1. Container-to-Container communications(pod)
2. Pod-to-Pod communications(overlay network)
3. Pod-to-Service communications(kube-proxy and packet filter on node)
4. External-to-Service communications(kube-proxy and packet filter on node
)

Requirements of implementing networking in Kube.

- All pods can communicate with each other across nodes.
- All nodes can communicate with all pods.
- No Network Address Translation (NAT).

Tools: Calico, Weave, Cilium

In Kubernetes, every Pod gets its own IP address, so there is no manual configuration involved. Moreover, most Kubernetes setups include **a DNS server add-on called core-dns**, which can provide service discovery and name resolution inside the cluster.

## Scheduling

scheduling is a sub-category of container orchestration and describes the process of automatically choosing the right (worker) node to run a containerized workload on.

### kube-scheduler

the kube-scheduler is the component that makes the scheduling decision, but is not responsible for actually starting the workload.

The scheduling process in Kubernetes always starts when a new Pod object is created. Remember that Kubernetes is using a declarative approach, where the Pod is only described first, then the scheduler selects a node where the Pod actually will get started by the kubelet and the container runtime.

It is possible that the desired state cannot be established, for example, because worker nodes do not have sufficient resources to run your application. In this case, the scheduler will retry to find an appropriate node until the state can be established.

## Kubernetes Objects

One of the core concepts of Kubernetes is providing a lot of mostly abstract resources, also called objects, that you can use to describe how your workload should be handled.

Kubernetes objects can be distinguished between workload-oriented objects that are used for handling container workloads and infrastructure-oriented objects, that for example handle configuration, networking and security. Some of these objects can be put into a namespace, while others are available across the whole cluster.

As a user, we can describe these objects in the popular data-serialization language YAML and send them to the api-server, where they get validated before they are created.

Almost every Kubernetes object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status. For objects that have a spec, you have to set this when you create the object, providing a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its desired state.

The status describes the current state of the object, supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system and its components. The Kubernetes control plane continually and actively manages every object's actual state to match the desired state you supplied.

### Name and ID

Each object in your cluster has a Name that is unique for that type of resource. Every Kubernetes object also has a UID that is unique across your whole cluster.

For example, you can only have one Pod named myapp-1234 within the same namespace, but you can have one Pod and one Deployment that are each named myapp-1234.

For non-unique user-provided attributes, Kubernetes provides labels and annotations.

### Namespace

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.

Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces:

- default The default namespace for objects with no other namespace
- kube-system The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system
- kube-public This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.
- kube-node-lease This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. Node leases allow the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control plane can detect node failure.

Most Kubernetes resources (e.g. pods, services, replication controllers, and others) are in some namespaces. However namespace resources are not themselves in a namespace. And low-level resources, such as nodes and persistentVolumes, are not in any namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec: 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.19
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

required fields:

### apiVersion

Each object can be versioned. That means the data structure of the object can change between different versions.

### kind

The kind of object that should be created.

### metadata

Data that can be used to identify it. A name is required for each object and must be unique. You can use namespaces if you need multiple objects with the same name.

### spec

The specification of the object. Here you can describe your desired state. Be cautious, since the structure for the object can change with its version!

Creating, modifying or deleting an object is only a record of intent where you describe the state your objects should be in, youâ€™re not actively starting pods or even containers for that matter like you would do on your local machine and get direct feedback if it worked or not.

Advanced Tools: Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, which allows easier updates and interaction with objects. Helm packages Kubernetes objects in so-called Charts, which can be shared with others via a registry.

## Labels and selectors

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users.

Via a label selector, the client/user can identify a set of objects. The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes.

The API currently supports two types of selectors: equality-based and set-based.

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    component: redis
  matchExpressions:
    - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache]}
    - {key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
```

## Annotations

You can use Kubernetes annotations to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects. Clients such as tools and libraries can retrieve this metadata.

```yaml
"metadata": {
  "annotations": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}
```
