# Network Objects

Since a lot of Pods would require a lot of manually network configuration, we can use Service and Ingress objects to define and abstract networking.

Services can be used to expose a set of pods as a network service.

## Service

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.  
With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

### Service resources

In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service). The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector(allow user to filter resources using label). To learn about other ways to define Service endpoints, see Services without selectors.

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible—frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves.

The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

Cloud-native service discovery
If you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

## Service Types

### ClusterIP

The most common service type. A ClusterIP is a virtual IP inside Kubernetes that can be used as a single endpoint for a set of pods. This service type can be used as a round-robin load balancer.

### NodePort

The NodePort service type extends the ClusterIP by adding simple routing rules. It opens a port (default between 30000-32767) on every node in the cluster and maps it to the ClusterIP. This service type allows routing external traffic to the cluster.

### LoadBanlancer

The LoadBalancer service type extends the NodePort by deploying an external LoadBalancer instance. This will only work if you’re in an environment that has an API to configure a LoadBalancer instance, like GCP, AWS, Azure or even OpenStack.

### ExternalName

A special service type that has no routing whatsoever. ExternalName is using the Kubernetes internal DNS server to create a DNS alias. You can use this to create a simple alias to resolve a rather complicated hostname like: my-cool-database-az1-uid123.cloud-provider-i-like.com. This is especially useful if you want to reach external resources from your Kubernetes cluster.

If you need even more flexibility to expose applications, you can use an Ingress object. Ingress provides a means to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside of the cluster for a service within the cluster. It does this by configuring routing rules that a user can set and implement with an ingress controller.

**Example of Ingress**

Standard features of ingress controllers may include:

- LoadBalancing
- TLS offloading/termination
- Name-based virtual hosting
- Path-based routing

A lot of ingress controllers even provide more features, like:

- Redirects
- Custom errors
- Authentication
- Session affinity
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Weighted routing
- Rate limiting.

Kubernetes also provides a cluster internal firewall with the NetworkPolicy concept.

You can define rules for incoming (ingress) and outgoing traffic (egress). A typical use case for NetworkPolicies would be restricting the traffic between two different namespaces.
