# Network Objects

Since a lot of Pods would require a lot of manually network configuration, we can use Service and Ingress objects to define and abstract networking. 

Kubernetes IP addresses exist at the Pod scope - containers within a Pod share their network namespaces - including their IP address and MAC address. This means that containers within a Pod can all reach each other's ports on localhost

Services can be used to expose a set of pods as a network service.

## Service

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.  
With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

### Service resources

In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service). **The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector**(allow user to filter resources using label).

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible—frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves.

The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

#### Cloud-native service discovery

you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

### Services without selector

Service has no selector, the corresponding Endpoints object is not created automatically. You can manually map the Service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an Endpoints object manually:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: my-service
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.0.2.42
    ports:
      - port: 9376
```

Accessing a Service without a selector works the same as if it had a selector. In the example above, traffic is routed to the single endpoint defined in the YAML: 192.0.2.42:9376 (TCP).  
An ExternalName Service is a special case of Service that does not have selectors and uses DNS names instead.

### Virtural IPs and service proxies

Every node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a kube-proxy. **kube-proxy is responsible for implementing a form of virtual IP for Services of type other than ExternalName**.

## Discovery Services

**Kubernetes supports 2 primary modes of finding a Service - environment variables and DNS**.

### Environment variables

When a Pod is run on a Node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service. It adds {SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST and {SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT variables.

```none
REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.11
REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_PORT=6379
```

### DNS

You can (and almost always should) set up a DNS service for your Kubernetes cluster using an add-on.

A cluster-aware DNS server, such as CoreDNS, watches the Kubernetes API for new Services and creates a set of DNS records for each one. If DNS has been enabled throughout your cluster then all Pods should automatically be able to resolve Services by their DNS name.

For example, if you have a Service called my-service in a Kubernetes namespace my-ns, the control plane and the DNS Service acting together create a DNS record for my-service.my-ns. Pods in the my-ns namespace should be able to find the service by doing a name lookup for my-service (my-service.my-ns would also work).

## Headless Services

Sometimes you don't need load-balancing and a single Service IP. In this case, you can create what are termed "headless" Services, by explicitly specifying "None" for the cluster IP (.spec.clusterIP).

You can use a headless Service to interface with other service discovery mechanisms, without being tied to Kubernetes' implementation.

For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, **kube-proxy does not handle these Services**, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the platform for them. How DNS is automatically configured depends on whether the Service has selectors defined:

### With selectors

For headless Services that define selectors, the endpoints controller creates Endpoints records in the API, and modifies the DNS configuration to return A records (IP addresses) that point directly to the Pods backing the Service.

### Without selectors

For headless Services that do not define selectors, the endpoints controller does not create Endpoints records. However, the DNS system looks for and configures either:

CNAME records for ExternalName-type Services.
A records for any Endpoints that share a name with the Service, for all other types.

## Service Types

### ClusterIP

The most common service type. A ClusterIP is a virtual IP inside Kubernetes that can be used as a single endpoint for a set of pods. This service type can be used as a round-robin load balancer.

![ClusterIP](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/p5puunzoutt5-ClusterIP.png)

### NodePort

The NodePort service type extends the ClusterIP by adding simple routing rules. It opens a port (default between 30000-32767) on every node in the cluster and maps it to the ClusterIP. This service type allows routing external traffic to the cluster.

### LoadBanlancer

The LoadBalancer service type extends the NodePort by deploying an external LoadBalancer instance. This will only work if you’re in an environment that has an API to configure a LoadBalancer instance, like GCP, AWS, Azure or even OpenStack.

### ExternalName

A special service type that has no routing whatsoever. ExternalName is using the Kubernetes internal DNS server to create a DNS alias. You can use this to create a simple alias to resolve a rather complicated hostname like: my-cool-database-az1-uid123.cloud-provider-i-like.com. This is especially useful if you want to reach external resources from your Kubernetes cluster.  
Services of type ExternalName map a Service to a DNS name, not to a typical selector such as my-service or cassandra. You specify these Services with the spec.externalName parameter.

**Relations**

If you need even more flexibility to expose applications, you can use an Ingress object. Ingress provides a means to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside of the cluster for a service within the cluster. It does this by configuring routing rules that a user can set and implement with an ingress controller. **Not a service type**.

## DNS for Services and pods

Kubernetes DNS schedules a DNS Pod and Service on the cluster, and configures the kubelets to tell individual containers to use the DNS Service's IP to resolve DNS names.

Every Service defined in the cluster (including the DNS server itself) is assigned a DNS name. By default, a client Pod's DNS search list includes the Pod's own namespace and the cluster's default domain.

What objects get DNS records?

1. Services
2. Pods

## Using services

### cmd

`kubectl expose deployment/my-nginx`

### YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    run: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
```

This specification will create a Service which targets TCP port 80 on any Pod with the run: my-nginx label, and expose it on an abstracted Service port (targetPort: is the port the container accepts traffic on, port: is the abstracted Service port, which can be any port other pods use to access the Service). View Service API object to see the list of supported fields in service definition. Check your Service:

As mentioned previously, a Service is backed by a group of Pods. These Pods are exposed through endpoints. The Service's selector will be evaluated continuously and the results will be POSTed to an Endpoints object also named my-nginx. When a Pod dies, it is automatically removed from the endpoints, and new Pods matching the Service's selector will automatically get added to the endpoints. Check the endpoints, and note that the IPs are the same as the Pods created in the first step:

```none
kubectl describe svc my-nginx
Name:                my-nginx
Namespace:           default
Labels:              run=my-nginx
Annotations:         <none>
Selector:            run=my-nginx
Type:                ClusterIP
IP:                  10.0.162.149
Port:                <unset> 80/TCP
Endpoints:           10.244.2.5:80,10.244.3.4:80
Session Affinity:    None
Events:              <none>
```

## Ingress

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.  
The name of an Ingress object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.

![Ingress](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/gzq2hbu6v0wv-Ingress.png)  
**Example of Ingress**

Standard features of ingress controllers may include:

- LoadBalancing
- TLS offloading/termination
- Name-based virtual hosting
- Path-based routing

A lot of ingress controllers even provide more features, like:

- Redirects
- Custom errors
- Authentication
- Session affinity
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Weighted routing
- Rate limiting.

Kubernetes also provides a cluster internal firewall with the NetworkPolicy concept.

You can define rules for incoming (ingress) and outgoing traffic (egress). A typical use case for NetworkPolicies would be restricting the traffic between two different namespaces.
