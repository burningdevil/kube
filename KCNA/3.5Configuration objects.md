## Configurtion objects

Applications have config files, connect to other services, databases, storage systems or caches and that requires configuration like connection strings.

### ConfigMap

In Kubernetes, this problem is solved by decoupling the configuration from the Pods with a ConfigMap. ConfigMaps can be used to store whole configuration files or variables as key-value pairs. There are two possible ways to use a ConfigMap:

- Mount a ConfigMap as a volume in Pod
- Map variables from a ConfigMap to environment variables of a Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-conf
data:
  nginx.conf: |
    user nginx;
    worker_processes 3;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
...
      server {
          listen     80;
          server_name _;
          location / {
              root   html;
              index  index.html index.htm; } } }
```

use in pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/nginx
      name: nginx-conf
  volumes:
  - name: nginx-conf
    configMap:
      name: nginx-conf
```

### Secrets

Right from the beginning Kubernetes also provided an object to store sensitive information like passwords, keys or other credentials. These objects are called Secrets.

Secrets are very much related to ConfigMaps and basically their only difference is that secrets are base64 encoded.
