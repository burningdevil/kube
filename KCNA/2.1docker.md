## Images

### Dockerfile

The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The buildâ€™s context is the set of files at a specified location PATH or URL. The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.

```Dockerfile
# Every container image starts with a base image.
# This could be your favorite linux distribution
FROM ubuntu:20.04 

# Run commands to add software and libraries to your image
# Here we install python3 and the pip package manager
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install python3 python3-pip 

# The copy command can be used to copy your code to the image
# Here we copy a script called "my-app.py" to the containers filesystem
COPY my-app.py /app/ 

# Defines the workdir in which the application runs
# From this point on everything will be executed in /app
WORKDIR /app

# The process that should be started when the container runs
# In this case we start our python app "my-app.py"
CMD ["python3","my-app.py"]
```

### Build context

When you issue a docker build command, the current working directory is called the build context.

### Exclude with .dockignore

### Reduce image size

#### Multi-stage build

```Dockerfile
FROM node:8 as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json index.js ./
RUN npm install

FROM node:8

COPY --from=build /app /
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["index.js"]
```

#### Remove unnecessary cruf from container with distroless

"Distroless" images contain only your application and its runtime dependencies. They do not contain package managers, shells any other programs you would expect to find in a standard Linux distribution.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:8 as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json index.js ./
RUN npm install

FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs

COPY --from=build /app /
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["index.js"]
```

#### Smaller base images with Alpine

a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox

```Dockerfile
FROM node:8 as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json index.js ./
RUN npm install

FROM node:8-alpine

COPY --from=build /app /
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
