# Workload Objects

Working just with Pods would not be flexible enough in a container orchestration platform. For example, if a Pod is lost because a node failed, it is gone forever. To make sure that a defined number of Pod copies runs all the time, we can use controller objects that manage the pod for us.  
Pods are generally not created directly and are created using workload objects.

### ReplicaSet

A controller object that ensures a desired number of pods is running at any given time. ReplicaSets can be used to scale out applications and improve their availability. They do this by starting multiple copies of a pod definition.

### Deployment

The most feature-rich object in Kubernetes. A Deployment can be used to describe the complete application lifecycle, they do this by managing multiple ReplicaSets that get updated when the application is changed by providing a new container image, for example. Deployments are perfect to run stateless applications in Kubernetes.  
A Deployment provides declarive updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.  

### StatefulSet

StatefulSets can be used to run stateful applications like databases on Kubernetes. Stateful applications have special requirements that don't fit the ephemeral nature of pods and containers.  
In contrast to Deployments, StatefulSets try to retain IP addresses of pods and give them a stable name, persistent storage and more graceful handling of scaling and updates.  
Manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and **guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods**.  
Like a Deployment, **StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on identical container spec**. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.  
If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed.

#### Using StatefulSets

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

- Stable, unique network identifiers.
- Stable, persistent storage.
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
- Ordered, automated rolling updates.

#### Limitions

- The storage for a given Pod must either be provisioned by a PersistentVolume Provisioner based on the requested storage class, or pre-provisioned by an admin.
- Deleting and/or scaling a StatefulSet down will not delete the volumes associated with the StatefulSet. This is done to ensure data safety, which is generally more valuable than an automatic purge of all related StatefulSet resources.
- StatefulSets currently require a Headless Service to be responsible for the network identity of the Pods. You are responsible for creating this Service.
- StatefulSets do not provide any guarantees on the termination of pods when a StatefulSet is deleted. To achieve ordered and graceful termination of the pods in the StatefulSet, it is possible to scale the StatefulSet down to 0 prior to deletion.
- When using Rolling Updates with the default Pod Management Policy (OrderedReady), it's possible to get into a broken state that requires manual intervention to repair.

#### Update strategies

A StatefulSet's .spec.updateStrategy field allows you to configure and disable automated rolling updates for containers, labels, resource request/limits, and annotations for the Pods in a StatefulSet. There are two possible values:

- OnDelete  
When a StatefulSet's .spec.updateStrategy.type is set to OnDelete, the StatefulSet controller will not automatically update the Pods in a StatefulSet. Users must manually delete Pods to cause the controller to create new Pods that reflect modifications made to a StatefulSet's .spec.template.
- RollingUpdate  
The RollingUpdate update strategy implements automated, rolling update for the Pods in a StatefulSet. This is the default update strategy

### DaemonSet

Ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on all (or some) nodes of your cluster. DaemonSets are perfect to run infrastructure-related workload, for example monitoring or logging tools.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

- running a cluster storage daemon on every node
- running a logs collection daemon on every node
- running a node monitoring daemon on every node

**The name of a DaemonSet object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.**

DaemonSets are similar to Deployments in that **they both create Pods, and those Pods have processes which are not expected to terminate** (e.g. web servers, storage servers).

Use a Deployment for stateless services, like frontends, where scaling up and down the number of replicas and rolling out updates are more important than controlling exactly which host the Pod runs on. **Use a DaemonSet when it is important that a copy of a Pod always run on all or certain hosts**, if the DaemonSet provides node-level functionality that allows other Pods to run correctly on that particular node.

For example, network plugins often include a component that runs as a DaemonSet. The DaemonSet component makes sure that the node where it's running has working cluster networking.

#### How Daemon Pods are scheduled

A DaemonSet ensures that all eligible nodes run a copy of a Pod. Normally, the node that a Pod runs on is selected by the Kubernetes scheduler. However, DaemonSet pods are created and scheduled by the DaemonSet controller instead. That introduces the following issues:

- Inconsistent Pod behavior: Normal Pods waiting to be scheduled are created and in Pending state, but DaemonSet pods are not created in Pending state. This is confusing to the user.
- Pod preemption is handled by default scheduler. When preemption is enabled, the DaemonSet controller will make scheduling decisions without considering pod priority and preemption.

#### Communicating with Daemon Pods

Some possible patterns for communicating with Pods in a DaemonSet are:

- Push: Pods in the DaemonSet are configured to send updates to another service, such as a stats database. They do not have clients.
- NodeIP and Known Port: Pods in the DaemonSet can use a hostPort, so that the pods are reachable via the node IPs. Clients know the list of node IPs somehow, and know the port by convention.
- DNS: Create a headless service with the same pod selector, and then discover DaemonSets using the endpoints resource or retrieve multiple A records from DNS.
- Service: Create a service with the same Pod selector, and use the service to reach a daemon on a random node. (No way to reach specific node).

### Job

Creates one or more Pods that execute a task and terminate afterwards. Job objects are perfect to run one-shot scripts like database migrations or administrative tasks.

A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.

A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).

You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

### CronJob

CronJobs add a time-based configuration to jobs. This allows running Jobs periodically, for example doing a backup job every night at 4am.
